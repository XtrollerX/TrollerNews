# TrollerNews

A simple kotlin and XML based news application which displays the top news from NewsApi.org. I have included a local Database for the storing of news articles which you may like! 

I am using custom chrome tabs which will significantly increase the loading speed of clicked articles. Saving an article could be done using the Kebab menu at the bottom right of each article view.
